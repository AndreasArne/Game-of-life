# Game-of-life
Implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)

TO-DO:
* Implement web version
* <s>Read starting gamefield from file so can test [patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns)</s>
* <s>Pixel graphics for gamefield so not only showing 0 and 1. Using Turtle</s>
    * <s>Try other GUI library, Turtle is slow!</s> Fixed by turning of animations and delays.
* Implement an object oriented version.
* Inject pattern into size dimensional list instead of using using patterns size for gamefield.
* Try other implementations of the algorithm.
